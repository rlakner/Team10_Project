Since the scrape_images function cannot be automatically tested, here is a 
testing procedure to determine if it is successful.

- Perform the procedure outlined in scrape_items_testing.text to obtain the
    list of items used in the scrape_images function 
- Open the Python script that has the DepopScraper class and call the 
    scrape_images function with the returned items list as an argument
- Verify that the function returns a list of dictionaries with the direct link
    to items as the key and an image source link as the value
- For each item in the list:
    - Open the image source link (the value assigned to the key)
    - Compare the image with the actual image displayed on the Depop website
    for that item
