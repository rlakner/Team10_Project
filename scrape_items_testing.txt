Since the scrape_items function cannot be automatically tested, here is a 
testing procedure to determine if it is successful.

- Open the Depop website https://www.depop.com/ 
- Search for any item using their search feature
- Look at the search results (if there are any)
- Open the Python script that has the DepopScraper class and call the 
    scrape_items function with the search term you used on the website as the
    required argument 
- Verify that the function returns a list of Item objects 
- Compare the name, price, condition, and link attributes of the Item 
    objects in the returned list with the corresponding results displayed
    by the Depop website 
- Test a search where no results are found and ensure that the scrape_items
    function raises the appropriate error
